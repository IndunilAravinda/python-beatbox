A music mixer built using python pygame to have fun playing around with beats. This is a project to learn python and pygame library to be specific

To create an exe file out of this python project, it is done and tested with auto-py-to-exe as a output directory. Important notice, this project is a tutorial followed project from Freecodecamp with some of my own tweaks and modifiations and they have this wonderful project guided with step by step guidance (great explanations for anyone to learn).
